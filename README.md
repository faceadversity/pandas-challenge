# PyCitySchools / pandas-challenge
# Background
It is assumed that I have become the new Chief Data Scientist for my school's district. My main tasks are to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. The first objective would be to  analyze the district-wide standardized test results. Access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend will be in my possession for data analysis. The main priority at hand would be aggregating the data presented to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Pandas and Jupyter Notebook were implemented in the formation of all data analysis regarding the school districts in question. The raw data included necessary calculations and a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame. They are as follows:
# District Summary
  * Total number of unique schools
  * Total students
  * Total budget
  * Average math score
  * Average reading score
  * % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
  * % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
  * % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
# School Summary
  * School name
  * School type
  * Total students
  * Total school budget
  * Per student budget
  * Average math score
  * Average reading score
  * % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
  * % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
  * % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
